Add API and automation features to FluentCommunity for managing members via external payment systems.

== Description ==

This add-on extends the FluentCommunity plugin by providing an integration layer for external payment providers such as CopeCart and Digistore24.

It enables full automation of user access management, including:

* Mapping digital products to courses and spaces
* Handling Instant Payment Notifications (IPNs)
* Auto-creating user accounts and granting access
* Managing expirations and cancellations via cronjob
* REST API endpoints for external integration
* Admin override functionality for manual control

Use this plugin to connect your external shop system with your FluentCommunity-powered WordPress site.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin ZIP via **Plugins > Installieren > Plugin hochladen** in your WordPress admin
2. Activate the plugin
3. Make sure **FluentCommunity** is installed and active
4. Go to **Einstellungen > FluentCommunity Extreme** to configure the plugin
5. Map products to courses or spaces under the Product Mapping section

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work without FluentCommunity? =
No. This plugin is an add-on and requires FluentCommunity to be installed and active.

= Which payment providers are supported? =
Currently CopeCart and Digistore24, via their IPN (Instant Payment Notification) systems.

= Can I manually override access? =
Yes. Admins can override access to spaces and courses independent of payment status.

= What happens when a product expires or is cancelled? =
Access is automatically revoked unless another active product grants access to the same space or course.
